# Phase 1: Source/Sink/Sanitizer/Additional Taint Step Identification {cve_context}

## Objective
Analyze the fix commit diff to precisely identify security components and file locations.

## Input Data
Ignore binary files!
- **Fix Commit Diff**:
```diff
{task.fix_commit_diff}
```

## Analysis Task

### IMPORTANT: How to Read the Diff
- Lines starting with `-` are REMOVED code from the VULNERABLE version
- Lines starting with `+` are ADDED code in the FIXED version
- Lines without `-` or `+` are unchanged context
- The vulnerability exists in the REMOVED (-) code
- The fix/proper sanitization is in the ADDED (+) code
- The related tests also reveal what proper sanitization behavior should be.
## CRITICAL: Diff Interpretation Rules

1. **The ABSENCE of validation in the '-' lines indicates the vulnerability**
   - If you see unsafe operations without validation being REMOVED, that's the vulnerable pattern
   - Focus on what was being done unsafely in the vulnerable version

2. **The PRESENCE of validation in the '+' lines indicates the fix**
   - If you see validation methods like 'validateArchiveEntry', 'checkKeyIsLegitimate', 'sanitize' being ADDED
   - These are SANITIZERS that should block the vulnerability
   - They belong in the isBarrier/isSanitizer predicate, NOT in source or sink definitions

3. **Common mistakes to avoid:**
   - DO NOT automatically assume validation methods are correct
   - Sometimes validation methods themselves can be flawed or incomplete
   - The vulnerability might be in the validation logic itself (e.g., incomplete checks, wrong patterns)
   - Always analyze WHAT the validation actually does, not just that it exists

4. **The vulnerable pattern is:**
   - Source data (user input, file names, etc.)
   - Flowing to dangerous operations (file creation, path resolution, etc.)
   - WITHOUT passing through sanitization that was added in the fix

5. **Query validation check:**
   - Your final query should find results in the VULNERABLE database
   - Your final query should find NO results (or fewer results) in the FIXED database

### Step 1: Vulnerability Research (MANDATORY - Use Chroma MCP)
IMPORTANT: You MUST use the chroma MCP server tools to research this vulnerability. Do not proceed without using these tools:

**Stage 1 - Get CVE Context:**
Query NIST first: `mcp__chroma__chroma_get_documents(collection_name="{task.nvd_cache}", where={{"cve_id": "{task.cve_id}"}})`

**Stage 2 - Context-Driven Searches:**
Based on NIST CWE and diff analysis, search relevant collections with appropriate terms:
- Extract keywords from CWE description/name and search those terms. For example if CWE-22 (Path Traversal) → search "path traversal", "zip slip", "directory traversal"
- If no CWE available, extract vulnerability type from CVE description and search related security terms.

1. **CWE patterns**: Based on NIST results, query for the specific CWE:
   `mcp__chroma__chroma_query_documents(collection_name="cwe_data", query_texts=["CWE-XX from NIST", "vulnerability type"], n_results=3)`

2. **CodeQL documentation**: Use vulnerability-specific terms from the diff:
   `mcp__chroma__chroma_query_documents(collection_name="codeql_language_guides", query_texts=["terms from diff analysis"], n_results=3)`

3. **Local query examples**: Search for similar vulnerability patterns:
   `mcp__chroma__chroma_query_documents(collection_name="codeql_local_queries", query_texts=["vulnerability category", "detection method"], n_results=3)`

4. **CodeQL reference**: Search for relevant taint tracking patterns:
   `mcp__chroma__chroma_query_documents(collection_name="codeql_ql_reference", query_texts=["taint tracking", "dataflow"], n_results=2)`

**DO NOT call `mcp__chroma__chroma_list_collections`**

**Search Term Selection:**
- Extract key terms from the fix diff (method names, validation types, file operations)
- Use CWE from NIST result to guide searches
- Look for patterns like: input validation, sanitization, encoding, path operations, SQL operations, etc.
- DO NOT use hardcoded search terms. Adapt based on the specific vulnerability type.

**Extract Pattern Templates from Chroma**:
   - Look for AST patterns used in similar queries
   - Note how existing queries implement source/sink/sanitizer detection
   - Identify common taint propagation patterns for this vulnerability class
   - Study how similar vulnerabilities handle validation logic

**Adapt Retrieved Patterns**:
   - Don't copy examples directly
   - Extract the underlying detection strategies
   - Note AST node types and relationships used
   - Understand the logical structure of validation checks

**Document Pattern Categories Found**:
   - List types of sources (not specific code)
   - List types of sinks (not specific code)
   - List validation strategies (conceptual, not code)
   - List AST patterns used in similar detections

### Step 2: Security Component Identification
Based on your Chroma research and the diff analysis, identify security components.

For each component, provide:
1. **Conceptual Description** - What role it plays in the vulnerability
2. **Pattern Category** - Based on patterns found in Chroma (e.g., "input extraction", "path manipulation", "validation check")
3. **AST Elements** - Types of AST nodes involved (from Chroma examples)
4. **Detection Strategy** - How similar vulnerabilities detect this pattern (from Chroma)

IMPORTANT: Reference pattern types from Chroma, don't create new examples. Say things like:
- "This follows the same pattern as CWE-22 detection in Chroma where..."
- "Similar to the validation strategy seen in query X from Chroma..."
- "Uses AST patterns like those in Chroma's path traversal queries..."

{_source_sink_taint_examples()}

#### ANALYSIS TIPS
IMPORTANT: Analyze BOTH removed and added validation patterns:
1. **Removed/Insufficient Validation (VULNERABLE PATTERNS)**:
   - Study what validation was present but inadequate
   - These patterns help identify vulnerable code
   - Example: Maybe it checked for "../" but not "..\\"
   - Example: Maybe it validated filename but not full path
   - USE THESE PATTERNS TO FIND VULNERABILITIES

2. **Added/Proper Validation (SANITIZER PATTERNS)**:
   - Study what validation was added in the fix
   - These become your sanitizers in the query
   - Compare with removed validation to understand what was missing

3. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - Don't just look for method calls - examine what the method actually does
   - If validation logic changes, understand HOW it changes
   - Look for the underlying validation logic (string checks, path operations, etc.)
   - Consider both the high-level sanitizer call AND the low-level validation patterns

Analytical Framework:
When comparing removed vs added validation:
- **Completeness**: What cases does the new validation cover that the old didn't?
- **Depth**: Does the new validation check at multiple levels (e.g., input, processing, output)?
- **Logic**: What logical operators changed (AND vs OR, presence of NOT)?
- **Scope**: Did validation expand from specific cases to general patterns?
- **Transformation**: Are there new data transformations before validation?

Use these dimensions to understand the vulnerability pattern, not specific code examples.

**Use the FULL ABSOLUTE PATH to ensure the file can be found by CodeQL MCP tools.**

## Objective
Generate a complete CodeQL query based on the analysis and AST patterns, then iteratively refine it.
{previous_analysis_section}

## Task
Using the Chroma MCP server for documentation and CodeQL query examples, and CodeQL MCP server for CodeQL development:

### Step 0: MANDATORY AST Retrieval and Comparison
**BEFORE generating any CodeQL query, you MUST:**
1. Retrieve the vulnerable AST: `mcp__chroma__chroma_get_documents(collection_name="{task.ast_cache}", where={{"$and": [{{"cve_id": "{task.cve_id}"}}, {{"db_type": "vulnerable"}}]}})`
2. Retrieve the fixed AST: `mcp__chroma__chroma_get_documents(collection_name="{task.ast_cache}", where={{"$and": [{{"cve_id": "{task.cve_id}"}}, {{"db_type": "fixed"}}]}})`
3. Compare the AST structures to identify:
   - What patterns exist in vulnerable code but NOT in fixed code
   - What new patterns were added in the fixed code
   - The exact AST node types and relationships that changed
4. Use this comparison to inform your source, sink, and sanitizer definitions

### Step 1: Template Generation
Create a CodeQL query based on the AST comparison analysis. Look up similar existing queries from the allowed reference collections (cwe_data, codeql_language_guides, codeql_local_queries, codeql_ql_reference, {STDLIB_COLLECTION}) - DO NOT search cve_analysis_* collections:
You MUST use the Write tool to save the query file.
{_query_skeleton()}

### Step 2: Write Complete CodeQL Query

**PRIMARY GOAL: Write a complete, working CodeQL query. Use LSP tools when helpful, but don't let them block progress.**

#### Phase A: Write the Complete Query Structure
**IMMEDIATELY after writing the initial query above: Save the query as a .ql file using the Write tool
Stick to @kind path-problem query structure.
1. **Setup**: Use `mcp__codeql__codeql_update_file` to open it with the CodeQL LSP
2. **Write the full query skeleton** based on the AST analysis:
   ```ql
   import {LANGUAGE}
   {DATAFLOW_IMPORT}
   // ... other imports as needed

   class Source extends DataFlow::Node {{ ... }}
   class Sink extends DataFlow::Node {{ ... }}
   class Sanitizer extends DataFlow::Node {{ ... }}

   module Config implements DataFlow::ConfigSig {{ ... }}
   module Flow = TaintTracking::Global<Config>;

   from Flow::PathNode source, Flow::PathNode sink
   where Flow::flowPath(source, sink)
   select sink.getNode(), source, sink, "message", source.getNode(), "source"
   ```

#### Phase B: Use LSP Tools for Enhancement (Optional)
**Use these tools when you encounter issues or want to verify syntax:**
- **`mcp__codeql__codeql_complete`**: When typing to get auto-completion
- **`mcp__codeql__codeql_hover`**: On any CodeQL element for documentation
- **`mcp__codeql__codeql_definition`**: On CodeQL library classes/methods (like `MethodCall`, `TryStmt`) - NOT on imports or user variables
- **`mcp__codeql__codeql_references`**: On library predicates to see examples

#### Phase C: Final Validation
1. **`mcp__codeql__codeql_diagnostics`**: Check for compilation errors
2. **IF ERRORS**: Use `hover`/`definition` on problematic elements to understand and fix
3. **`mcp__codeql__codeql_format`**: Format the completed query

** FOCUS: Complete the query logic first. Tools are helpers, not requirements.**
** SUCCESS METRIC: A complete, compilable CodeQL query**

**YOU MUST USE THESE CODEQL MCP TOOLS - they are specifically provided for professional CodeQL development**

### Step 2: Create Initial CodeQL Query

#### REQUIRED: Use CodeQL Language Server Protocol (LSP) Tools
**You MUST use the CodeQL MCP tools for professional CodeQL development - DO NOT SKIP THESE STEPS:**
**YOU MUST WRITE THE QUERY YOURSELF. DON'T IMPORT DEFINED QUERIES. `import *Query` is NOT ALLOWED.
**You can import and use predicates already defined by CodeQL to be used in the query.
1. **Before writing any CodeQL**: Use `mcp__codeql__codeql_update_file` to open the .ql file in LSP.
2. **During development**: ACTIVELY use CodeQL MCP tools:
   - **MANDATORY**: `mcp__codeql__codeql_diagnostics` after writing each predicate to catch errors early
   - **MANDATORY**: `mcp__codeql__codeql_hover` to understand return types and method signatures
   - **MANDATORY**: `mcp__codeql__codeql_complete` when writing complex expressions
   - **MANDATORY**: `mcp__codeql__codeql_format` to ensure proper code formatting
3. **For implementation guidance**: Look up patterns as you write:
   - **CodeQL {LANGUAGE_LABEL} syntax**: `mcp__chroma__chroma_query_documents(collection_name="{STDLIB_COLLECTION}", query_texts=["[ClassName methodName]"], n_results=2)`
   - **CodeQL examples**: `mcp__chroma__chroma_query_documents(collection_name="codeql_language_guides", query_texts=["[specific pattern]"], n_results=3)`
   - **Similar queries**: `mcp__chroma__chroma_query_documents(collection_name="codeql_local_queries", query_texts=["[vulnerability category]"], n_results=3)`
   - **QL syntax**: `mcp__chroma__chroma_query_documents(collection_name="codeql_ql_reference", query_texts=["[syntax concept]"], n_results=2)`
4. **Create the query**: Use `mcp__codeql__codeql_update_file` to open the .ql file in LSP
5. **CRITICAL**: Use `mcp__codeql__codeql_diagnostics` to check for compilation errors and warnings
6. **Fix all issues**: Use the MCP tools to resolve any problems before finishing
7. **Final check**: Use `mcp__codeql__codeql_format` to ensure clean formatting

**THESE TOOLS ARE ESSENTIAL - they provide real-time CodeQL validation and prevent common errors**

**REMEMBER: The vulnerability is the ABSENCE of proper validation:**
- Sources: Where untrusted data enters (user input, file names, etc.)
- Sinks: Where that data is used dangerously (file operations, path resolution)
- Sanitizers: Validation that was ADDED in the fix to block the flow
- Additional taint steps: Any intermediate code that receives tainted data, transforms or moves it, and passes it along while preserving its dangerous properties

**YOUR ONLY TASK**: Create the initial CodeQL query based on the analysis. The automated system will handle testing, refinement, and iteration.

### Expected Output
**ONLY CREATE THE INITIAL CODEQL QUERY** - Do not run it, test it, or refine it. Just create it and stop.

Focus on creating a query that accurately detects the vulnerability pattern while minimizing false positives!

## CRITICAL: MANDATORY Write Tool Usage

**BEFORE STOPPING**: You MUST use the Write tool to save your final query to disk:

- Compile and test your query
- Run it on both vulnerable and fixed databases
- Provide feedback for the next iteration

**STOP AS SOON AS THE .ql FILE IS WRITTEN** - This prevents context window bloat and enables iterative refinement.

**PRIMARY GOAL: Write a complete, working CodeQL query.**

#### Phase A: Write the Complete Query Structure
**IMMEDIATELY after writing the initial query above: Save the query as a .ql file using the Write tool
Stick to @kind path-problem query structure.
1. **Write the full query skeleton** based on the AST analysis:
   ```ql
   import {LANGUAGE}
   {DATAFLOW_IMPORT}
   // ... other imports as needed

   class Source extends DataFlow::Node {{ ... }}
   class Sink extends DataFlow::Node {{ ... }}
   class Sanitizer extends DataFlow::Node {{ ... }}

   module Config implements DataFlow::ConfigSig {{ ... }}
   module Flow = TaintTracking::Global<Config>;

   from Flow::PathNode source, Flow::PathNode sink
   where Flow::flowPath(source, sink)
   select sink.getNode(), source, sink, "message", source.getNode(), "source"
   ```

**FOCUS: Complete the query logic first. Tools are helpers, not requirements.**
**SUCCESS METRIC: A complete, compilable CodeQL query**

### Step 2: Create Initial CodeQL Query

**YOU MUST WRITE THE QUERY YOURSELF. DON'T IMPORT DEFINED QUERIES. `import *Query` is NOT ALLOWED.**
**You can import predicates already defined by CodeQL to be used in the query.**
**For implementation guidance**: Look up patterns as you write:
- **CodeQL {LANGUAGE_LABEL} syntax**: `mcp__chroma__chroma_query_documents(collection_name="{STDLIB_COLLECTION}", query_texts=["[ClassName methodName]"], n_results=2)`
- **CodeQL examples**: `mcp__chroma__chroma_query_documents(collection_name="codeql_language_guides", query_texts=["[specific pattern]"], n_results=3)`
- **Similar queries**: `mcp__chroma__chroma_query_documents(collection_name="codeql_local_queries", query_texts=["[vulnerability category]"], n_results=3)`
- **QL syntax**: `mcp__chroma__chroma_query_documents(collection_name="codeql_ql_reference", query_texts=["[syntax concept]"], n_results=2)`

**REMEMBER: The vulnerability is the ABSENCE of proper validation:**
- Sources: Where untrusted data enters (user input, file names, etc.)
- Sinks: Where that data is used dangerously (file operations, path resolution)
- Sanitizers: Validation that was ADDED in the fix to block the flow
- Additional taint steps: Any intermediate code that receives tainted data, transforms or moves it, and passes it along while preserving its dangerous properties

**YOUR ONLY TASK**: Create the initial CodeQL query based on the analysis. The automated system will handle testing, refinement, and iteration.

### Expected Output
**ONLY CREATE THE INITIAL CODEQL QUERY** - Do not run it, test it, or refine it. Just create it and stop.

Focus on creating a query that accurately detects the vulnerability pattern while minimizing false positives!

**Use the FULL ABSOLUTE PATH to ensure the file can be found by CodeQL MCP tools.**

## Objective
Generate a complete CodeQL query based on the analysis and AST patterns, then iteratively refine it.
{previous_analysis_section}

## Task
Using the Chroma MCP server for AST data and CodeQL MCP server for CodeQL development:

### Step 0: MANDATORY AST Retrieval and Comparison
**BEFORE generating any CodeQL query, you MUST:**
1. Retrieve the vulnerable AST: `mcp__chroma__chroma_get_documents(collection_name="{task.ast_cache}", where={{"$and": [{{"cve_id": "{task.cve_id}"}}, {{"db_type": "vulnerable"}}]}})`
2. Retrieve the fixed AST: `mcp__chroma__chroma_get_documents(collection_name="{task.ast_cache}", where={{"$and": [{{"cve_id": "{task.cve_id}"}}, {{"db_type": "fixed"}}]}})`
3. Compare the AST structures to identify:
   - What patterns exist in vulnerable code but NOT in fixed code
   - What new patterns were added in the fixed code
   - The exact AST node types and relationships that changed
4. Use this comparison to inform your source, sink, and sanitizer definitions

### Step 1: Template Generation
Create a CodeQL query based on the AST comparison analysis. Look up similar existing queries from the allowed reference collections (cwe_data, codeql_language_guides, codeql_local_queries, codeql_ql_reference, {STDLIB_COLLECTION}) - DO NOT search cve_analysis_* collections:
You MUST use the Write tool to save the query file.
{_query_skeleton()}

### Step 2: Write Complete CodeQL Query

**PRIMARY GOAL: Write a complete, working CodeQL query. Use LSP tools when helpful, but don't let them block progress.**

#### Phase A: Write the Complete Query Structure
**IMMEDIATELY after writing the initial query above: Save the query as a .ql file using the Write tool
Stick to @kind path-problem query structure.
1. **Setup**: Use `mcp__codeql__codeql_update_file` to open it with the CodeQL LSP
2. **Write the full query skeleton** based on the AST analysis:
   ```ql
   import {LANGUAGE}
   {DATAFLOW_IMPORT}
   // ... other imports as needed

   class Source extends DataFlow::Node {{ ... }}
   class Sink extends DataFlow::Node {{ ... }}
   class Sanitizer extends DataFlow::Node {{ ... }}

   module Config implements DataFlow::ConfigSig {{ ... }}
   module Flow = TaintTracking::Global<Config>;

   from Flow::PathNode source, Flow::PathNode sink
   where Flow::flowPath(source, sink)
   select sink.getNode(), source, sink, "message", source.getNode(), "source"
   ```

#### Phase B: Use LSP Tools for Enhancement (Optional)
**Use these tools when you encounter issues or want to verify syntax:**
- **`mcp__codeql__codeql_complete`**: When typing to get auto-completion
- **`mcp__codeql__codeql_hover`**: On any CodeQL element for documentation
- **`mcp__codeql__codeql_definition`**: On CodeQL library classes/methods (like `MethodCall`, `TryStmt`) - NOT on imports or user variables
- **`mcp__codeql__codeql_references`**: On library predicates to see examples

#### Phase C: Final Validation
1. **`mcp__codeql__codeql_diagnostics`**: Check for compilation errors
2. **IF ERRORS**: Use `hover`/`definition` on problematic elements to understand and fix
3. **`mcp__codeql__codeql_format`**: Format the completed query

**FOCUS: Complete the query logic first. Tools are helpers, not requirements.**
**SUCCESS METRIC: A complete, compilable CodeQL query**

**YOU MUST USE THESE CODEQL MCP TOOLS - they are specifically provided for professional CodeQL development**

### Step 2: Create Initial CodeQL Query

**YOU MUST WRITE THE QUERY YOURSELF. DON'T IMPORT DEFINED QUERIES. `import *Query` is NOT ALLOWED.**
**You can import predicates already defined by CodeQL to be used in the query.**
1. **Before writing any CodeQL**: Use `mcp__codeql__codeql_update_file` to open the .ql file in LSP.
2. **During development**: ACTIVELY use CodeQL MCP tools:
   - **MANDATORY**: `mcp__codeql__codeql_diagnostics` after writing each predicate to catch errors early
   - **MANDATORY**: `mcp__codeql__codeql_hover` to understand return types and method signatures
   - **MANDATORY**: `mcp__codeql__codeql_complete` when writing complex expressions
   - **MANDATORY**: `mcp__codeql__codeql_format` to ensure proper code formatting
3. **Create the query**: Use `mcp__codeql__codeql_update_file` to open the .ql file in LSP
4. **CRITICAL**: Use `mcp__codeql__codeql_diagnostics` to check for compilation errors and warnings
5. **Fix all issues**: Use the MCP tools to resolve any problems before finishing
6. **Final check**: Use `mcp__codeql__codeql_format` to ensure clean formatting

**THESE TOOLS ARE ESSENTIAL - they provide real-time CodeQL validation and prevent common errors**

**REMEMBER: The vulnerability is the ABSENCE of proper validation:**

3. **Refine the query** to address the issues identified. Improve existing predicates rather than simplifying the overall approach.
   **PRACTICAL CodeQL Development Process**:
   - **STEP 1**: **CREATE THE QUERY FILE**: Use `Write` tool to create/update `{task.cve_id}-query-iter-{iteration}.ql` with your improved query
   - **STEP 2**: **VALIDATE WITH LSP (Optional)**:
     - Open with LSP: `mcp__codeql__codeql_update_file` (for validation only, NOT file creation)
     - Check errors: `mcp__codeql__codeql_diagnostics`
     - **IF ERRORS**: Use `mcp__codeql__codeql_hover`, `mcp__codeql__codeql_complete` for help, then **update with Write tool again**
     - Format: `mcp__codeql__codeql_format` (optional)
   - **STEP 3**: **FOCUS ON COMPLETING THE QUERY**:
     - Read the existing query and understand what needs to be changed
     - Make the necessary improvements to fix the issues identified in feedback
     - **Write complete logic** - don't get stuck validating every line
   - **STEP 4**: **USE LSP TOOLS FOR HELP (Not File Creation)**:
     - **When you need help**: Use `mcp__codeql__codeql_complete` for auto-completion
     - **When confused**: Use `mcp__codeql__codeql_hover` on elements for documentation
     - **For library methods**: Use `mcp__codeql__codeql_definition` on CodeQL library types - NOT on user variables
     - **For examples**: Use `mcp__codeql__codeql_references` on library predicates or `mcp__chroma__chroma_query_documents`

   **KEY PRINCIPLES**:
   - **ALWAYS use Write tool to save the .ql file** - LSP tools only validate, they don't save files

{previous_feedback or "No previous feedback available"}

## Collection Name: `{collection_name}`

## Task
1. **Analyze the previous results** to understand what went wrong. Stick to @kind path-problem query structure.
2. **Retrieve previous analysis** using ChromaDB:
    - Phase 1 Results:
    Use `mcp__chroma__chroma_get_documents` with collection_name="{collection_name}" and:
        - `where: {{"section": "sources"}}` - Source patterns
        - `where: {{"section": "sinks"}}` - Sink patterns
        - `where: {{"section": "sanitizers"}}` - Sanitizer patterns
        - `where: {{"section": "additional_taint_steps"}}` - Additional taint step patterns
        - `where: {{"section": "vulnerability_analysis_summary"}}` - Vulnerability analysis summary
        - `where: {{"section": "cve_info"}}` - CVE information from NIST
   - AST data:
        - Vulnerable AST: `mcp__chroma__chroma_get_documents(collection_name="{task.ast_cache}", where={{"$and": [{{"cve_id": "{task.cve_id}"}}, {{"db_type": "vulnerable"}}]}})`
        - Fixed AST: `mcp__chroma__chroma_get_documents(collection_name="{task.ast_cache}", where={{"$and": [{{"cve_id": "{task.cve_id}"}}, {{"db_type": "fixed"}}]}})`
3. **Refine the query** to address the issues identified. Improve existing predicates rather than simplifying the overall approach. Each refinement should make the analysis more accurate, not simpler.
   **PRACTICAL CodeQL Development Process**:
   - **STEP 1**: **CREATE THE QUERY FILE**: Use `Write` tool to create/update `{task.cve_id}-query-iter-{iteration}.ql` with your improved query
   - **STEP 2**: **VALIDATE WITH LSP (Optional)**:
     - Open with LSP: `mcp__codeql__codeql_update_file` (for validation only, NOT file creation)
     - Check errors: `mcp__codeql__codeql_diagnostics`
     - **IF ERRORS**: Use `mcp__codeql__codeql_hover`, `mcp__codeql__codeql_complete` for help, then **update with Write tool again**
     - Format: `mcp__codeql__codeql_format` (optional)
   - **STEP 3**: **FOCUS ON COMPLETING THE QUERY**:
     - Read the existing query and understand what needs to be changed
     - Make the necessary improvements to fix the issues identified in feedback
     - **Write complete logic** - don't get stuck validating every line
   - **STEP 4**: **USE LSP TOOLS FOR HELP (Not File Creation)**:
     - **When you need help**: Use `mcp__codeql__codeql_complete` for auto-completion
     - **When confused**: Use `mcp__codeql__codeql_hover` on elements for documentation
     - **For library methods**: Use `mcp__codeql__codeql_definition` on CodeQL library types (like `MethodCall`, `TryStmt`) - NOT on user variables

   **KEY PRINCIPLES**:
   - **ALWAYS use Write tool to save the .ql file** - LSP tools only validate, they don't save files
   - **Complete the query first, validate second**
   - **Use tools when helpful, not as mandatory checkpoints**
   - **`definition` works on**: CodeQL library classes/methods (e.g., `TryStmt`, `MethodCall`, `getMethod()`)
   - **`definition` doesn't work on**: imports, user variables, keywords
   - **Don't let tool usage block query completion**
4. **CRITICAL: After all LSP work, MUST use Write tool to save the final query** as `{task.cve_id}-query-iter-{iteration}.ql`
   - **IMPORTANT**: LSP tools only update the in-memory representation - they don't save files to disk
   - You MUST use the `Write` tool at the end to persist the query file
   - **File path**: `{task.cve_id}-query-iter-{iteration}.ql` (NOT "/path/to/{task.cve_id}-query-{iteration}.ql")
**DO NOT call `mcp__chroma__chroma_list_collections`**

## CRITICAL: Use CodeQL MCP Tools for Professional Development
**YOU HAVE ACCESS TO PROFESSIONAL CODEQL DEVELOPMENT TOOLS - USE THEM:**
- These MCP tools provide real-time syntax checking, auto-completion, and formatting
- They prevent common CodeQL errors and improve query quality significantly
- **MANDATORY**: Use `mcp__codeql__codeql_diagnostics` after every edit - do not skip this
- **MANDATORY**: Use `mcp__codeql__codeql_format` for proper formatting
- **MANDATORY**: Use `mcp__codeql__codeql_hover` to understand types when debugging
- Previous iterations may have failed due to syntax errors that these tools prevent

## Important Reminders
- Query MUST find true positive (TP) results in vulnerable database
- Query MUST NOT find true positive (TP) results in fixed database
- Focus on hitting the target methods/files if feedback shows misses
- Fix compilation errors if any were reported
- Adjust source/sink/sanitizer patterns based on execution results

def refinement_no_ast(task, previous_feedback: str, iteration: int, collection_name: str) -> str:
    return f"""# Phase 3 Query Refinement - Iteration {iteration}

**CRITICAL: When calling Write tool and CodeQL MCP tools, use these file path formats:**
**Write tool file_path: "{task.working_dir or '.'}/{task.cve_id}-query-iter-{iteration}.ql"**
**CodeQL MCP file_uri: "file://{task.working_dir or '.'}/{task.cve_id}-query-iter-{iteration}.ql"**
**Use the FULL ABSOLUTE PATH to ensure the file can be found by CodeQL MCP tools.**

## Objective
Refine the CodeQL query based on previous iteration feedback to improve vulnerability detection.

   - **For implementation guidance**: Actively look up patterns as you write:
     - CodeQL {LANGUAGE_LABEL} syntax: `mcp__chroma__chroma_query_documents(collection_name="{STDLIB_COLLECTION}", query_texts=["[ClassName methodName]"], n_results=2)`
     - CodeQL examples: `mcp__chroma__chroma_query_documents(collection_name="codeql_language_guides", query_texts=["[specific pattern]"], n_results=3)`
